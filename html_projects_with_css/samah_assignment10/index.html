                    <p>The oncoming of Easter had no effect on the laziness of Tom.
                        He sulked at getting up early, so subdued to his indolence, was sleeping in his cozy bed. &nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>But what charm would the morning hold without the proactive Jerry creating mischief and
                        disturbing
                        Tom all the time?</p>
                    <p>After gulping down a few chunks of cheese, Jerry started feeling uneasy.
                        Why uneasy? Easter decorations gone wrong. . no they were quite perfect. .
                        Missed the radio show of Maria, the singing doe. . not maybe. . Couldn't read the end of
                        magazine Mice Mania,&nbsp;no that's not the reason.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Like a flash of the bulb, the reason for uneasiness came up and Jerry ran off to Tom's room. With
                        a
                        master plan bubbling in the head, he pulled Tom's whiskers with all his might. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Next time you pull a cat's whiskers, take care to stay away from its paws. Whack! Jerry got
                        banged
                        to the wall as sleepy Tom merely waved his paw to brush off the hindrance to his sound sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>It took some time for Jerry to regain his shape, but a new plan had come up this time.
                        He slowly catwalked&nbsp;to the kitchen, his gaze fixed on the kitchen table. Next moment ,
                        he landed near the eggs (which were meant for Tom's breakfast). You needn't advise Jerry on
                        the topic - How to play pranks on Tom?</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>And the plan was brought to execution, Jerry marched on Tom's body,
                        creating a tickling sensation which just made Tom giggle, that's all. . Jerry banged
                        the egg he had brought from kitchen into Tom's eye and safely made it to the ground. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Would Tom stay quiet?No, it's utterly impossible. It was just not a angry 'meeooww ',
                        but Tom had picked him up by the tail and swung him merrily in the air. He marched with
                        pride, and simply dropped him in the dirty puddle of water.</p>

                    <p>You might be wondering about the muddy puddle. . It's not a effect of heavy rain,&nbsp;I say ,but
                        a remnant of the mess Tom and Jerry had ended upto with pails of water,hoses and all water
                        around the day before.</p>
                    <p>With a cold stare at Tom, who was lazing on the couch,&nbsp;he brushed all the mud and dirt
                        aside. A needle laying on the wavering path caught his attention. And a glance at Tom, who at
                        the moment, had risen to get some food from the fridge. So, fully set for a new prank!
                    </p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>He ran to an unbeatable speed, going unnoticed as he placed the needle on the couch. It was
                        exactly at the place where Tom had sat a few moments before. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Arrghh! The bowl of popcorn nearly slipped out of his hand. . And this set Jerry into an outburst
                        of laughter. But the next move was quite unexpected. Tom tied notorious Jerry's tail to a small
                        Easter cracker. Jerry ran berserk as the sparks neared his lovely thin tail. What else could he
                        do?
                    </p>
                    <p>'Boom!' Jerry's face had all gone black and this time it was Tom's chance to laugh out loud. But
                        the laughter was short-lived. . .
                    </p>
                    <p>Little Jerry tugged at Tom's tail and tied it to the leg of a small chair . . . Agitated, Tom ran
                        after Jerry, chasing him after he had freed himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>Following Jerry to the garden,&nbsp;he picked up the golf stick and aimed it at the running
                        Jerry. He missed by a few inches, but the chase has not ended yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>He darted to the kitchen and picked a frying pan. And slowly following Jerry, he made a move.
                        Bang! Jerry nearly seemed an omelet, being badly flattened. &nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>It's Tom and Jerry, and the story would never end. . Endless are the pranks of both, always
                        spicing it with comedy. . . But let's say a temporary goodbye to our funny friends. &nbsp;
                    </p>

                <div class="s-cover">

                <div class="s-script s-script-2">
                    <p>After the death of her parents, the little girl Heidi is raised by her mother's sister, Aunt
                        Dete. After four years, when Heidi was 5 years old, Dete got a good job offer from the noble
                        family Sesemann from Frankfurt. Dete cannot take Heidi to Frankfurt, so she brings Heidi to her
                        Grandfather on the alp.<br><br> On the alp at her Grandfather, Heidi is really happy for the
                        first time in her life: she spends every day in the meadows with Peter and the beloved goats and
                        has the opportunity to marvel at the variety of flowers and the beauty of nature.<br><br> So two
                        absolutely happy years pass. When Heidi should start school, the pastor appears on the alp.
                        However, the Grandfather thinks the girl will be spoiled in the village and refuses to send
                        Heidi to school. On the same day, Aunt Dete also appears to take Heidi to Frankfurt. There she
                        is supposed to keep company with the disabled daughter of the house - Klara. However, Heidi only
                        goes with her aunt because she promises that she can go back to the Alp immediately if she
                        doesn't like it in Frankfurt.<br><br> Heidi expects a completely new and unknown world in
                        Frankfurt: Instead of rustling firs, mountains and meadows, Heidi now meets wide streets, many
                        people and tall houses in the middle of the big city. Klara and Heidi will soon be best friends
                        who play numerous pranks on the evil and tyrannical governess - Miss Rottenmeier. These delight
                        not only the two young girls, but also the servant Sebastian, who quickly proves to be the
                        girls' secret helper. Klara's grandmother quickly took the little mountain girl to her heart and
                        teaches her to read, while Mister Sesemann quickly notices that Heidi is doing his daughter
                        good.<br><br> Despite the deep friendship with Klara, Heidi constantly suffers from
                        homesickness, which robs her of sleep. When the doctor catches her when she sleepwalks, he
                        orders her to go home. After two entertaining and amusing years, the farewell is very difficult,
                        especially for Klara. Heidi, on the other hand, enjoys being back on the Alp with her
                        Grandfather, with Peter and their goats and, thanks to the reading courses in Frankfurt, being
                        able to even read Peter's blind grandmother from the book.<br><br> Before the next winter, the
                        Grandfather and Heidi moves down to the village and the goats. So Heidi can go to school. Heidi
                        teached Peter and as a result Peter go to school too. After the snow melts in spring, everyone
                        moves to the alp. In a letter from Klara, she wrote that the doctor had prescribed her a cure in
                        Bad Ragaz for the summer so that she could visit Heidi on the alp every day. However, the summer
                        passes without Klara appearing on the alp.<br><br> In late autumn only the doctor appears alone.
                        Since the only daughter died a few months ago, his zest for life has vanished. Heidi succeeds in
                        getting the doctor up again and bringing him back the joy of life. Thereupon the doctor leaves
                        Switzerland strengthened and comforted and he tells Klara over and over again how nice it is
                        with Heidi on the alp.<br><br> The next summer it will be time. Klara and her grandmother come
                        to visit! However, the jealous Peter, who is afraid that Heidi now has no time for him, has
                        little joy about the visit from Germany. Out of anger he pushes Klara's wheelchair down the
                        mountain, where it crashes.<br><br> Thanks to the care of the Grandfather, the fresh mountain
                        air and the goat's milk, Klara is getting stronger and finally learns to walk. When her father
                        also comes to visit the Alp and Klara runs towards him all alone, he cannot believe his own eyes
                        and is overjoyed. When Mister Sesemann asks the Grandfather and Heidi how he can show himself
                        recognizable for the care and recovery of his daughter, the Grandfather only says that he only
                        wishes that Heidi always can be independently and never has to earn her living from
                        strangers.<br><br> Heidi's only wish was that Peter's old and blind grandmother be brought the
                        big bed from Frankfurt with a blanket and pillow so that she never had to freeze again. Mister
                        Sesemann promises to fulfill Heidi's wish and assures the Grandfather that he does not have to
                        worry about the future of his grandchild.</p>

                    <p>
                        I am going to write a letter to you, and I will begin by telling you that my name is Judy
                        Abbott. I am eighteen years old, and I have been an orphan ever since I was born. My only
                        relatives are a great aunt, a distant cousin, and an old woman who lives in the country and who
                        does not know how to keep house. She had no use for me, so they sent me to this orphanage when I
                        was just a tiny child.
                        <br><br>
                        But today something has happened. It is a big event, and I must tell you about it. It is about
                        the new thing in my life, and I don't think it will be any worse than any other event I have
                        had, because my life has been all events. I have had no holidays, no parties, no cake or candy
                        except once a year at Christmas when we have a big treat. I think all children should have
                        holidays and treats. It is very unfair for one who is not rich to have nothing but the regular
                        schoolwork and little punishments that come with it.
                        <br><br>
                        Anyway, today I was called into the office of the Superintendent of the orphanage, and there was
                        a man there, tall and thin, with a long black coat and a hat that made his face look very
                        mysterious. I think I was frightened at first. But he said he had come to see me, and I was to
                        go with him. I had no idea what to think about it, because I had no idea who he was, but I went
                        along anyway. Then I discovered that he was not a stranger, but a gentleman who had come to
                        arrange a special thing for me.
                        <br><br>
                        And the wonderful part is that this gentleman has offered to send me to college! He will pay all
                        the expenses and take care of everything for me. And all he wants in return is that I write him
                        letters occasionally, and tell him about what happens to me. That’s all! He said he was not
                        interested in my studies or grades, only in how I feel and what happens in my daily life.
                        <br><br>
                        I don't know what to think of it. I feel happy and excited, but also a little scared. What if he
                        is a wicked man, and he plans to make me his slave? I don't think so, because he seems kind and
                        generous. Besides, the superintendent of the orphanage has known him for a long time, and she
                        says he is a very good man, and she trusts him completely.
                        <br><br>
                        So, I think I am going to like this new life. I am going to write to you, and tell you all about
                        the things I do and see. You will know everything that happens to me, and I will be your friend.
                        You can give me advice if you like, but remember, I don’t need anyone to boss me around.
                        <br><br>
                        Yours faithfully,
                        <br>
