            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Engineering Miracle</h3>
                <p>The Great Pyramid was considered the tallest man-made structure for about 3,800 years until the 19th century. The most baffling aspect isn't its height, but how ancient Egyptians built such a monumental structure using prehistoric tools and techniques. Even with today's advanced technology, replicating these pyramids would be extraordinarily challenging.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Pyramids' Whopping Weight</h3>
                <p>The Great Pyramid alone has a mass of 5.9 million tons and a volume of 2.5 million cubic meters. Without cranes or modern machinery, ancient Egyptians transported, lifted, and precisely placed stone blocks weighing 5-10 tons each! The pyramid consists of 203 steps, positioned with remarkable precision. Curiously, no documents or reliefs explaining this process have ever been discovered.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Afterlife Journey</h3>
                <p>Ancient Egyptians believed Pharaohs were descendants of the gods, holding significant status in society. Their belief in an afterlife journey necessitated elaborate tombs where they stored food, precious possessions, and clothing. Beyond serving as burial chambers, pyramids were thought to spiritually guide souls into the afterlife, accompanied by complex rituals including mummification to ensure continued existence after death.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Enigmatic Serdab</h3>
                <p>The Serdab or "Cellar" was a vital structure near the Pharaoh's corpse that housed the Ka Statue. Egyptians believed this statue contained the Pharaoh's life essence after death, providing insurance against mummy destruction by allowing the soul to inhabit the statue until reaching the afterlife. With tombs filled with treasures vulnerable to theft, the Serdab and Ka statue were essential for ensuring a peaceful journey.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Hieroglyph Texts</h3>
                <p>Hieroglyphic texts offer insights into ancient Egyptian culture, history, and civilization. The inscriptions on inner passages and burial chamber walls were actually spells designed to guide Pharaohs safely to the afterlife. As the world's oldest religious texts, these meticulously carved inscriptions continue to captivate people worldwide with their mystery and beauty.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Mysterious Coffer</h3>
                <p>Inside the Great Pyramid's main chamber lies an enormous granite coffer that presents a fascinating puzzle: it's too large to fit through the narrow entrance passage. Archaeologists still debate whether it was brought in during construction or if the pyramid was built around it—adding another layer to the pyramid's many mysteries.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Pharaohs' Curse</h3>
                <p>While the Sphinx was believed to guard deceased kings, the legendary Pharaoh's curse supposedly protected pyramids, rulers, and their possessions. Though experts attribute sudden illnesses near tombs to bacteria, many Egyptians maintain that the curse is real. What do you believe?</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Slave Myth</h3>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief spread by Herodotus, the Great Pyramids weren't built by slaves. Research shows they were constructed by skilled artisans and paid workers who were highly respected and well-fed. Those who died during construction were buried near the Pharaohs' tombs with jars of food—a clear sign of honor and respect.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">The Location Theory</h3>
                <p>In 1877, researchers discovered that the Great Pyramid is located precisely at the center of Earth's landmass. Ancient Egyptians believed the setting sun guided Pharaohs to their necropolis, and studies confirm the pyramids are positioned exactly where the sun sets. Furthermore, all pyramids point north, resembling constellation patterns—showcasing an advanced astronomical knowledge that remains mysterious today.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="fact-item">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Constant Temperature of 20°C</h3>
                <p>Despite external temperature fluctuations and harsh desert conditions, the pyramids maintain a constant internal temperature of 20°C (68°F). This ancient "air conditioning" system demonstrates sophisticated engineering knowledge that scientists still struggle to fully explain.</p>
