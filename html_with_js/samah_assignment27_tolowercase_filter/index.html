                    marvel.
    
                    Let‚Äôs bust some myths and uncover some surprising facts about the Great Pyramids of Giza. Shall we?!

                    <li class="mb-3 fw-medium">
                        Engineering Miracle The Great Pyramid was considered the tallest man-made structure for about 3,800 years until the
                        19th century. Can you imagine? ‚Äì However, the baffling thing about it isn‚Äôt the height, but the
                        ability to build such a significant figure using prehistoric tools and techniques. Even with the high
                        technology and sophisticated machines, it was hard, if not impossible, to replicate these huge pyramids.

                        The Pyramids‚Äô Whopping Weight
                        Did you know that the Great Pyramid alone has a mass of 5.9 million tons and a volume of 2.5
                        million
                        cubic meters? ‚Äì With no cranes or advanced machinery, the ancient Egyptians could transfer,
                        lift, and
                        join blocks, weighing from 5 to 10 tons each! The pyramid consists of 203 steps, gracefully
                        placed with
                        striking perfection and precision. Unfortunately, the ancient Egyptians didn‚Äôt leave any
                        document or
                        relief to explain the mysterious process.

                        The Afterlife Journey
                        According to an ancient belief, the Pharaohs are the descendants of the Gods, so they had a
                        significant
                        position among the Egyptians. Believing in the afterlife journey, they needed tombs to serve as
                        their
                        burial place, where they kept their food, precious possessions, and clothing with them. That‚Äôs
                        how the
                        idea of a majestic pyramid started!

                        Aside from being their burial tombs, they believed that pyramids spiritually escort their souls
                        into the
                        afterlife. Their religious beliefs resulted in a variety of complex rituals and ceremonies to
                        get ready
                        for this transition cycle, including mummification. To ensure continuity of life after their
                        death,
                        people would pay homage to the Gods for a safe trip. Also, offering tables were set outside the
                        burial
                        chamber with food, drinks, and household equipment to be used in the glorious afterlife.

                        The Enigmatic Serdab
                        As the ancient Egyptians believed in immortality and the afterlife, building their pyramids was
                        a
                        crucial thing. As important as their pyramids was the enigmatic Serdab, also known as ‚ÄúCellar.‚Äù
                        It was
                        an ancient structure close to the Pharaoh‚Äôs corpse, where they kept his Ka Statue. The ancient
                        Egyptians
                        believed that this statue held the Pharaoh‚Äôs life essence after death. So, by any means, if the
                        mummy
                        was destroyed, his soul can escape and live inside the statue until the afterlife. With the
                        magnificent
                        treasures and wonders inside the tombs, they suffered the danger of theft and ruins. The Serdab
                        and Ka
                        statue were the keys for a pleasant and serene journey.

                        The Hieroglyph Texts
                        Normally, the Hieroglyph texts depict the life in ancient Egypt, giving an insight into the
                        culture, and
                        history, and civilization. They give a glimpse of the Pharaohs‚Äô beliefs, responsibilities, and
                        lives
                        centuries ago. The texts inscribed on the inner passages and burial chambers‚Äô walls are actually
                        spelled
                        to help the Pharaohs pass safely to the afterlife. Being the oldest religious texts in the
                        world, these
                        delicately-carved inscriptions have stirred people‚Äôs attention and aroused their curiosity all

                        Another puzzle, inside the main chamber of the Great Pyramid, the archaeologists found a huge
                        granite
                        coffer. At the first sight, you won‚Äôt find anything suspicious or strange. But on second

                        you‚Äôll notice that the coffer is too large to pass through the narrow entrance passage. It was
                        never
                        identified whether it was brought in after construction or the great pyramid was built around

                        While the Sphinx was supposed to guard the dead kings, the Pharaoh‚Äôs curse is believed to offer
                        protection to the pyramids, and kings, along with their belongings. Although many experts stated
                        that

                        Many people believe that the Great Pyramids were built by slaves, following a theory developed
                        by
                        Herodotus. However, studies have shown that skilled artists and paid workers contributed to the
                        construction of this great wonder. The builders were highly respected, well-fed, and paid. Also,
                        the
                        workers who died during the construction were buried, with jars of food, next to the Pharaohs‚Äô

                        a sign of respect and honor.

                        The Location Theory
                        In 1877, a great discovery has revealed that the Great Pyramid is located exactly in the center
                        of all
                        the planet‚Äôs landmass. Amazing right?

                        According to an ancient belief, the setting sun was directed to the Pharaohs‚Äô necropolis. And, a
                        smart
                        observation has proved that the pyramids are situated exactly where the sunsets. It is proved
                        that the
                        pyramids are all pointed to the north, resembling constellations. This advanced knowledge and
                        precise

                        Despite the ever-changing temperatures and harsh conditions, the pyramids maintain a constant
                        temperature of 20¬∞C no matter what. Weird! How the ancient Egyptians managed to develop such an

                        and the
                        head of a human, resembling an Egyptian king. In ancient Egypt, the colossal limestone statue

                        The Once-glittering Pyramids
                        At the time of construction, the pyramids were polished with sparkling limestone white casing.
                        So, when
                        the sun was shining, the pyramids would literally sparkle like diamonds that they were seen from
                        far
                        away. Over time and with the effect of earthquakes and erosion, the coverings fell off the
                        pyramids
                        while others were cut off and used in other structures.

                        The memorable structure acts as a gigantic sundial. The pyramid‚Äôs shadows tell the hour
                        specifically
                        when they fall on marks carved in the stones. That‚Äôs is not it; the pyramid helped the Egyptians

                        and
                        chambers. These tunnels whispers with hundreds of mysterious tales and fuzzy secrets. Under the

                        However, this

                        years.

                        A Tragic Assault on Menkaure
                        Do you know that there were many intentions to demolish the magnificent Giza Pyramids?

                        Yes, this was the plan! There wouldn‚Äôt have been a trace of the Great Pyramids on earth,
                        destroying an
                        important part of our history. Such a shame!

                        During the 12th century, Al-Aziz Uthman, the second Ayybubid Sultan of Egypt, decided to destroy
                        the
                        Great Pyramids, encouraged by his ignorant court. He gathered a massive crew of workers and
                        ordered them
                        to pitch their tents near the site to start the destruction. Too determined, he didn‚Äôt spare any
                        expense
                        and even raised funds to complete what he started. For eight months, the workers tried every
                        technique
                        to remove the huge stone, ending in failure. They just succeeded to destroy the small stones and
                        fractions of the big ones. With every falling stone, the earth would tremble, causing a terrible
                        noise
                        and they weren‚Äôt even close.

                        Realizing the process is beyond them, the Sultan finally abandoned the idea, however, the tragic
                        attempt
                        resulted in a terrible gouge in the north face of Menkaure. This experiment gave us an idea of
                        the
                        ancient engineering brilliance and the significant work standing the test of time. And, that‚Äôs
                        how they
                        became the last surviving Wonder of the Ancient World!

                        The 20-ton Swivel Door
                        Over the years, various bizarre theories have circulated the construction process but they
                        always got
                        busted, leaving one of the biggest mysteries ever. Aside from the ridiculously-huge blocks, can
                        you
                        imagine that the Great Pyramid has three magnificent swivel doors, each weighing about 20 tons?
                        ‚Äì Yes,
                        astonishing! Surprisingly, the enormous door has the exact correct dimensions, perfect design,
                        and
                        specifications so it perfectly fits into the wall. It‚Äôs also well balanced that you can open it
                        with one
                        hand from the inside but impossible to open it from the outside. You can‚Äôt really hide your
                        amusement at
                        this well-crafted work, can you?

                        The Mastabas
                        Only the Pharaohs, elite, and powerful military figures had the privilege of being buried in
                        special
                        chambers inside the pyramids. So, Mastabas served as tombs for the ordinary people. Historians
                        believe
                        that the only reason behind their construction is that these souls will serve their kings in the
                        afterlife.

                        Majestic and accurate, the Great Pyramids have always been an enticing subject of research and
                        study.

                        a study
                        has estimated that the Great Pyramid took about 23 years to be completed.

                        Modeling the Benben Stone
                        You are probably wondering what the Benben Stone is. It is a primeval conical shape discovered
                        in the
                        Great Sun Temple in Heliopolis. This mysterious stone is associated with a famous Egyptian
                        methodology
                        in the ancient religion. According to the legend, this stone was the mound that rose from the
                        waters of
                        Nu, in which God Ra shaped our world. Many historians believe that the pyramids were originally
                        influenced and modeled from the Benben Stone.
